People can enjoy the beauty of nature there. \n[00:46.00]My grandma lives in the countryside and I go there for my summer holiday every year. \n[00:52.86]That must be fun. \n[00:55.27]2a Listen to the conversation and fill in the blanks. \n[01:57.30]Section B 1a Look, listen and say \n[02:04.00](Wang Wei is talking about the photos above with his friends.) \n[02:08.80]Hi, Michael! Which do you like better, plants or animals? \n[02:14.26]I like animals better. I keep a pet dog. I think animals are friendlier. \n[02:21.66]Why do you think so? \n[02:24.00]Because animals are our friends. They make us happy. \n[02:29.58]I like plants better. I think roses are the nicest of all the flowers. \n[02:36.50]But they can\u0027t play with you. What about you, Maria? \n[02:41.00]I like birds. They are beautiful, and they can sing to us. \n[02:46.84]I like cats best because they are cuter than any other animals. \n[02:53.38]I like both plants and animals. \n[02:57.00]As we know, they are both important to us.

It rains a lot and the ground is always wet. \n[05:11.33]It\u0027s always dark and hot in rainforests. \n[05:15.55]Rainforests cover 6% of the earth\u0027s surface. \n[05:20.55]They provide places to live for thousands of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth. \n[05:28.07]There are lots of tall trees and other different kinds of plants. \n[05:34.07]Thousands and thousands of animals live in rainforests. \n[05:39.15]Many of them live in the trees over 30 meters from the ground. \n[05:44.43]Rainforests are very important to us. They are the lungs of the earth. \n[05:50.71]The plants in the forests help to make the air fresher and cleaner. \n[05:56.21]They also help to hold the water when it rains and keep the water cycling.\n[06:02.34]They play an important part in controlling the climate. Rainforests also help to keep the beauty of nature. \n[06:10.79]Without rainforests, many beautiful plants and animals would die out. \n[06:17.12]Rainforests give us wood, food, fruit, medicine, and many more useful things. \n[06:25.68]We need rainforests for many reasons. \n[06:29.63]But, now, rainforests are becoming smaller and smaller, so we should protect them. \n[06:36.50]Section D 1 Read the passage and complete the table on Page 88. \n[06:45.00]Animals in Danger \n[06:47.60]Pandas live in the forests and mountains of Southwest China. \n[06:53.12]They feed on bamboo. But now they have less and less land to live on. \n[07:00.15]So pandas are becoming fewer in number. \n[07:04.12]The heaviest animals in the world are not elephants. They are blue whales.\n[07:10.89]They are the largest but they feed on the smallest sea animals. \n[07:16.41]Now they are in danger because some people make their ocean home dirty and others kill whales for their meat. \n[07:25.85]Chinese tigers live in the south of China. They are also in danger now. \n[07:32.45]They are the oldest type of tigers in the world and they eat small animals. \n[07:39.20]Some people kill tigers for their fur and bones. \n"},{"name":"0313 仁爱8上unit4_topic2","album":"http://p2.music.126.net/SQF5vSrxTZ5myrmVWxFStQ\u003d\u003d/3254554419585268.jpg","sound":"./grade/mid_8_up/lesson/0313 仁爱8上unit4_topic2.mp3","lrc":"[00:00.00]Unit 4 TOPIC 2 How can we protect ourselves from the earthquake? \n[00:07.50]Section A 1a Listen, look and say \n[00:14.16]Li Ming, come and look!

It was a level 7.1 earthquake. Many building fell down. \n[02:31.86]It killed more than two thousand people and hurt more. \n[02:37.50]I was very sad when I got the news. \n[02:41.19]Many children lost theirs homes and couldn\u0027t go to school. \n[02:45.82]Do you know how to protect yourselves from the earthquake? \n[02:50.50]I think we should run out of the door. \n[02:54.00]No, running out can be dangerous. \n[02:57.88]Miss Wang, do you think we should stay under the table? \n[03:02.60]Yes, I think so.

Some of these earthquake are very strong. \n[05:34.93]When they happen near a city, they can be very serious. Many people are hurt or die in the earthquakes. \n[05:43.50]Knowing some ways to protect yourself will help to keep you safe in the earthquake. \n[05:50.30]If you are indoors when the earthquake happens, the safest place is under a strong table or desk. \n[05:58.76]Sitting on the floor in a doorway or close to a wall is safer than standing in the middle of a room. \n[06:06.80]Remember to protect your head and neck with your arms. Stay away from windows, tall furniture and pictures or anything that may fall on you. \n[06:19.80]Do not try to run out of the building. \n[06:23.34]If you are out of doors, move to clear areas. Get away from buildings and trees. \n[06:31.17]Be very careful of fallen power lines. \n[06:35.00]The danger is not over when the strong shaking stops. \n[06:39.77]There will be some shocks after most earthquakes. \n[06:44.40]We call them aftershocks and they sometimes can be more dangerous than the first earthquake. \n[06:52.00]When it is safe for you to move around, check the people near you. Some may need help. \n[06:59.00]You may feel afraid, but you should try to stay calm. That is the most important thing to do in the earthquake. \n[07:08.26]Section D 1 Read the passage and complete the table on Page 96. \n[07:17.00](Here is the news from Wenchuan in Sichuan Province.) \n[07:22.22]At 2:28 in the afternoon, on May 12, 2008, a terrible earthquake happened here. \n[07:31.50]It killed more than 69000 people. Five million people lost their homes. \n[07:40.00]Many children died when their schools fell down. But with the help of the whole nation, people in Wenchuan are rebuilding their homes now and they are returning to normal life. \n[07:54.50]The children are able to study in new, safe schools.
